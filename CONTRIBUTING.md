First of all, thank you for taking the time to contribute!

Any kind of contribution is welcome. This includes:

- [Reporting bugs](https://github.com/voyager-tech-inc/vita49-rs/issues)
- Fixing bugs
- Adding features
- Asking questions

If you have a question, feel free to open an issue. It doesn't need
to be an actual issue with the software - general questions about usage
and strategy are welcome as well.

## Merge Requirements

For new code to be merged, please make sure the following criteria are
met:

- `cargo test` passes.
    - If new features are added, please add documentation and tests!
- `cargo clippy` passes with no warnings.
- `cargo fmt` has been run.
- Any new files have correct SPDX headers compliant with [REUSE](https://reuse.software/spec-3.3/).
- Pull requests add commits that apply cleanly onto `main`.
- Commit messages follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
- GitHub Workflows pass.
- If the change is significant, add a line to the [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) file.

### Signing Your Contribution

We require that all contributors "sign-off" on their commits. This
certifies that the contribution is your original work, or you have rights
to submit it under the same license, or a compatible license.

Any contribution which contains commits that are not Signed-Off will
not be accepted.

* To sign off on a commit you simply use the `--signoff` (or `-s`) option when committing your changes:
  ```bash
  $ git commit -s -m "feat: add cool feature"
  ```
  This will append the following to your commit message:
  ```
  Signed-off-by: Your Name <your@email.com>
  ```
