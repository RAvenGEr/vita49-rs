All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.0.4] - 2025-05-08

### Added

- Example of NATS command & control flow

### Changed

- Major rework of command packet processing [#6]

### Removed

- Visibility of certain CAM field manipulators limited:
  - `{enable,disable}_{controllee,controller}()`
  - `{,set_}{controllee,controller}_{id,uuid}_format()`
  - Instead, these are derived from `set_{controllee,controller}_id()`.
- CIF accessor methods for control packets have been moved to a sub-payload
  of command packets. So, you'll need to unwrap the payload. Your code update
  may look like:
```diff
-    command.set_bandwidth_hz(bw_hz);
-    command.set_rf_ref_freq_hz(freq_hz);
-    command.set_sample_rate_sps(sr_hz);
+    let control = command.payload_mut().control_mut().unwrap();
+    control.set_bandwidth_hz(bw_hz);
+    control.set_rf_ref_freq_hz(freq_hz);
+    control.set_sample_rate_sps(sr_hz);
```

## [0.0.3] - 2025-04-07

### Added

- Full support for CIF1 threshold field

### Changed

- Fixed various bit arithmetic bugs
- Fixed build error in benchmark app
- Various small CI fixes/improvements

### Removed

- `window_time_delta_ns()` accessor removed - replaced by `window_time_delta()`
- Visibility of `set_tsi()` and `set_tsf()` methods limited
- Binary test data replaced by JSON representations

## [0.0.2] - 2025-03-14
